# Coin Change Problem Solutions

## Description
This repository contains solutions for the Coin Change Problem implemented in C++. It includes two approaches:
1. A Greedy algorithm-based solution.
2. A Dynamic Programming-based solution.

The Coin Change Problem involves finding the minimum number of coins that make up a given amount of money, using coins of specified denominations.

## Installation
No special installation is required. A C++ compiler is necessary to compile and run the program.

## Usage
1. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Input the required sum and the available denominations as prompted.

## Examples
Input:
- Total Sum: 137
- Denominations: Dollar (100 cents), Quarter (25 cents), Dime (12 cents), Nickel (5 cents), Cent (1 cent)

Output:
- Greedy Algorithm: "Sum can't be constructed for this problem"
- Dynamic Programming: Total denominations used: 5

# Longest Common Subsequence Solutions

## Description
This repository contains two implementations for solving the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem: a simple recursive approach and a dynamic programming approach.

## Installation
No specific installation required. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed to run the program.

## Usage
1. Compile the C++ code.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the sequences.

## Examples
Input:
Sequence 1: "ABCBDAB"
Sequence 2: "BDCAB"

Output:
LCS Length (Recursive): 4
LCS Length (Dynamic Programming): 4
